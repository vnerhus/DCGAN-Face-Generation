# DCGAN-Face-Generation

### Description
Generates faces using a deep convolutional generative adversierial network (DCGAN), trained on the CelebA dataset.
Consists of two deep convolution networks, one generative- and one dicriminative network, working against eachother with the expected result being a generative network capable of generating new realistic images of faces.

The MNIST dataset is also included as an option for training and generation, mostly for the purpose of quickly testing the effectiveness of the model.

### Instructions
Run face_gen.py to train the networks. Close the images showing the generative networks progress to progress training.

## Important Note
Plots and imgaes must be closed for the program to continue.
