# DCGAN-Face-Generation

### Description
Generates faces using a deep convolutional generative adversierial network (DCGAN), trained on the CelebA dataset.
Consists of two deep convolution networks, one generative- and one dicriminative network, working against eachother with the expected result being a generative network capable of generating new realistic images of faces.
